London weather project

## Motivation
Despite living in Manchester, a city notorious for its wet and windy weather, I’ve developed an interest in understanding the dynamics of the weather in the UK. I chose to focus on London due to the availability of detailed public data, using it as a case study for England’s weather. This analysis attempts to make sense of the figures behind a frequent topic of local conversation: the weather.


## Data

- Nature of the data: Data based on real measurements. The [source](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/index.php) is public. The current form of the data is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data).
